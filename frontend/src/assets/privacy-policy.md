========================

Last Updated: 25/09/2024 11h45

1\. Introduction
----------------

Welcome to Zero-TOTP, a web application where users can securely store their TOTP codes for 2FA authentication with third-party services. At Zero-TOTP, we prioritize the privacy and security of your data. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information. By using our services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

  

This Privacy Policy aims to define the principles and guidelines implemented by the Zero-TOTP regarding the processing of personal data of users of the website zero-totp.com and rescue.zero-totp.com. The concept of "personal data" corresponds to the definition provided by Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (GDPR 2016/679). It refers to any information capable of directly or indirectly identifying a natural person, such as a username, email address, etc. Zero-TOTP affirms its commitment to complying with the applicable laws and regulations concerning data protection and undertakes to preserve their security, confidentiality, and integrity. Zero-TOTP formally commits not to sell, rent, exchange, or give away any personal information.

2\. Information We Collect
--------------------------

We collect the following information:

  

*   User Account Information: We collect your email address, username, and account creation date for the purpose of creating and managing your Zero-TOTP account.
*   Encrypted TOTP Codes: We use Zero-Knowledge Encryption to store your TOTP codes securely. We have no knowledge of your TOTP codes, secrets, or application URLs.
*   Google Drive Integration: If you choose to enable the backup of your vault to Google Drive, we store identifiers (protected by encryption) for Google Drive integration. You can revoke at any moment your google drive integration. This will lead to the deletion of your identifiers.
*   Authentication Cookies: We use authentication cookies to securely manage your sessions. No tracking cookies are used.
*   Last login date: We retain the datetime of your last login on Zero-TOTP. Once you log in again, the previous date in erased by the new one. This information is used for implementing the data retention policy (see 4. Data Retention and User Control).

3\. Use of Information
----------------------

We use your information for the following purposes:

  

*   User Authentication: To verify your identity and secure your account.
*   Encrypted Storage: To securely store your TOTP codes without knowledge of the actual codes, secrets, or application URLs.
*   Google Drive Backup: If enabled, to facilitate the backup of encrypted data to your Google Drive.
*   Customer Support: To respond to your inquiries and requests sent to developer\[at\]zero-totp.com.

4\. Data Retention and User Control
-----------------------------------

Data Retention: We retain all data, including vault information, for a maximum of five years after your last login to comply with GDPR's data storage limitations. You can request the deletion of your account and all associated data through the account settings at any time. You are responsible of the deletion of all the encrypted backups of your vault that you downloaded and that have been stored on Google Drive.  
  
Disaster recovery and data availability requirements mean that we have a legitimate interest in maintaining secure and immutable backups. Backups are kept for maxmimum 60 days. Erasure requests will leave those backups untouched, and we will only remove data from backups if legally compelled to.

  

Data Correction: You can update your username, email, passphrase, and codes (along with their associated data) in your account. For any other corrections, you can contact developer\[at\]zero-totp.com.

5\. Data storage location
-------------------------

To maximize redundancy, replication, and availability, we store data in three countries: Canada, Germany, and Switzerland. This practice is compliant with the GDPR, as all these countries are recognized by the EU as acceptable for data transfer. Additionally, we adhere to Swiss privacy laws and Quebec's Law 25 on data protection.  
  
Please note that the list of countries where data is stored may change in the future. If we add a new country that is not an EU member, Canada, the USA, or Switzerland, we will notify users accordingly.

6\. Security
------------

We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your data. Passwords are hashed using BCRYPT, and key derivation uses PBKDF2 with 700,000 iterations. Data is encrypted using AES 256-bit encryption.

7\. Third-Party Services
------------------------

If the user enables the Google Drive integration, we may integrate with third-party services for user convenience, such as Google Drive. Please review the privacy policies of these services, as we have no control over their data handling practices.

  

If the user enables the favicon preview, your browser will use the DuckDuckGo API to retrieve the favicon of the website. Please review the privacy policies of DuckDuckGo, as we have no control over their data handling practices. Zero-TOTP does not store any data related to the favicon preview, and the DuckDuckGo API is only used to retrieve the favicon of the website. The only data sent to DuckDuckGo is the URL of the website by your browser. Zero-TOTP does not access or store without encryption this data.
